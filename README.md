# Loan Grade Prediction — LendingClub
**ML Zoomcamp Capstone Project**

## Problem description

LendingClub assigned each loan a grade from A (lowest risk) to G (highest risk) based on the borrower's credit profile. This project builds a multi-class classifier that predicts a loan's grade from borrower attributes available at origination — replicating the kind of risk tiering decision used in consumer credit underwriting.

A deployed model could help a lender automatically route applications to the correct risk tier, price interest rates, or flag borderline cases for manual review.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle — adarshsng/lending-club-loan-data-csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshsng/lending-club-loan-data-csv)
- **Size**: ~2M rows, 150 columns
- **Target**: `grade` (A / B / C / D / E / F / G)

## Workflow

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| EDA | Class distribution, FICO vs grade, interest rate by grade, null analysis, correlation heatmap |
| Feature engineering | Drop post-origination leakage columns, impute nulls, encode categoricals |
| Baseline | Random Forest (scikit-learn) |
| Neural net | PyTorch MLP with embedding layers for categorical features |
| Evaluation | Weighted F1, macro F1, confusion matrix, classification report |
| Deployment | Flask API containerized with Docker |

## Results

| Model | Weighted F1 | Macro F1 |
|---|---|---|
| Random Forest | — | — |
| XGBoost | — | — |
| PyTorch MLP | — | — |

## Running locally

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the model
```bash
python train.py
```

### 3. Run the prediction service
```bash
python predict.py
```

### 4. Build and run with Docker
```bash
docker build -t loan-grade-predictor .
docker run -p 9696:9696 loan-grade-predictor
```

### 5. Test the endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9696/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"loan_amnt": 10000, "annual_inc": 65000, "dti": 18.5, "fico_range_low": 700, "purpose": "debt_consolidation", "home_ownership": "RENT", "emp_length": "5 years"}'
```

## Requirements
